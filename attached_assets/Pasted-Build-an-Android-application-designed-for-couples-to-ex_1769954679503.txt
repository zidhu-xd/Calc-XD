Build an Android application designed for couples to exchange secret messages and media while remaining completely hidden as a normal calculator app.

Core Concept

The app must look and function exactly like a real calculator. For a normal person, it should be indistinguishable from a standard calculator application.

Only when a specific 4 digit code is entered using the calculator keypad should the app unlock and reveal a hidden private chat interface.

Calculator Disguise Requirements

App opens directly into a fully working calculator

Calculator must perform real calculations correctly

No visible hint that the app is anything other than a calculator

If the wrong code or no code is entered, the app continues acting only as a calculator

When the correct 4 digit code is entered, navigate to the hidden chat UI

Pairing System

App uses a pairing code system

One user generates a pairing code

Another user joins using the same pairing code

Messages, media, and calls only work between paired users

Pairing code logic is the core communication logic

Messaging Features

WhatsApp style chat UI

One to one private chat only

Support:

Text messages

Images

Videos

Audio files

Voice recordings

Calling Features

Real time audio calling

Real time video calling

Calling experience similar to Telegram

Use WebRTC or any free real time communication solution

Calls must only work between paired users

Call history must remain hidden and vanish when app locks back to calculator mode

Privacy and Vanish Logic

When user presses:

Back button

Home button

Power button

App must instantly:

Hide chat UI

Switch back to calculator mode

Clear chat screen from recent apps view

No message content should be visible without entering the 4 digit code

Notifications

Notifications must not show message content

Notification text should look generic (example: Calculator notification)

Message content only visible after entering the 4 digit code inside the calculator

Backend and Database Constraints

I do NOT have money to buy paid services

Use only free tier solutions

Database must be free (example: Firebase free tier or similar alternative)

Optimize for minimal cost and bandwidth usage

Server Requirements

Create a backend using Node.js

Create a file named server.js

Place server.js inside a /render directory

Server must be compatible with Render.com free hosting

All APIs (auth, pairing, messaging, calls signaling) should use the Render hosted URL

👉 IMPORTANT:
Add clear comments in the code where I can insert or change:

// TODO: ADD YOUR OWN SERVER URL HERE


This hosted Render URL will be used as the base API URL throughout the Android app.

Technical Notes

Use free authentication method

Encrypt messages if possible using lightweight encryption

Ensure app performance is smooth on low end Android devices

UI should look modern but minimal

Final Behavior Summary

To outsiders: a normal calculator app

To paired users with the 4 digit code: a private messaging and calling app

No visible traces without unlocking

Strong privacy focused design
